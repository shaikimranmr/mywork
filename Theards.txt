1. What is multithreading in .NET, and why is it used?
Answer: Multithreading is the ability to run multiple threads (or independent paths of execution) simultaneously. It is used to improve the responsiveness of applications, especially in scenarios where long-running tasks (like file I/O, network operations) are needed without blocking the main thread, such as a UI thread.

2. What is the difference between a process and a thread?
Answer:

Process: An independent application with its own memory space and resources.
Thread: A smaller unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads in the same process share the same memory but run independently.
3. What is the Thread class in .NET, and how do you create a new thread?
Answer: The Thread class in .NET represents an independent path of execution. To create a new thread:

csharp
Copy code
Thread thread = new Thread(() =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Thread running");
});
thread.Start();
4. What is the difference between the Thread class and the Task class in .NET?
Answer:

Thread: Represents a low-level, explicit thread of execution. You manually create and manage the thread.
Task: Part of the Task Parallel Library (TPL), and is a higher-level abstraction. It manages thread creation and resource optimization internally. Tasks are used to handle background tasks more efficiently than raw threads.
5. What is ThreadPool in .NET, and how is it used?
Answer: ThreadPool provides a pool of worker threads that can be reused for short-lived operations, reducing the overhead of creating and destroying threads. Instead of creating new threads, you can queue tasks to the ThreadPool.

csharp
Copy code
ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(state =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Task running in thread pool");
});
6. What is the difference between Thread.Sleep() and Task.Delay()?
Answer:

Thread.Sleep(): Blocks the current thread for a specified period, preventing it from doing any work.
Task.Delay(): Asynchronously waits for a specified period without blocking the thread. It is non-blocking and commonly used in asynchronous programming.
7. What is a race condition, and how can you prevent it?
Answer: A race condition occurs when multiple threads try to access and modify shared data at the same time, leading to unexpected behavior. It can be prevented by:

Using synchronization techniques like lock, Mutex, Monitor, etc.
csharp
Copy code
lock (lockObject)
{
    // Code to protect shared resource
}
8. What is a deadlock, and how can you avoid it?
Answer: A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources. It can be avoided by:

Using a consistent order when locking multiple resources.
Implementing timeout mechanisms or using Monitor.TryEnter for acquiring locks with a timeout.
csharp
Copy code
if (Monitor.TryEnter(lockObject, 1000))  // 1-second timeout
{
    try
    {
        // Work with the shared resource
    }
    finally
    {
        Monitor.Exit(lockObject);
    }
}
9. How do you ensure thread safety in a multi-threaded environment?
Answer: You can ensure thread safety by:

Using locks (like lock keyword) to restrict access to shared resources.
Using thread-safe collections such as ConcurrentDictionary, ConcurrentBag, etc.
Leveraging atomic operations like Interlocked for simple operations like incrementing counters.
csharp
Copy code
lock (lockObject)
{
    // Thread-safe access to shared resource
}
10. What is a Mutex, and how is it different from a lock?
Answer:

A Mutex is a synchronization primitive that can be used across processes, while a lock is limited to threads within the same process.
Mutex can be useful when you need to synchronize access to resources across multiple applications or processes.
11. What is the lock keyword in C#, and when would you use it?
Answer: The lock keyword is used to ensure that a piece of code is accessed by only one thread at a time. It prevents race conditions by forcing threads to wait for each other before accessing shared resources.

csharp
Copy code
lock (lockObject)
{
    // Critical section
}
12. What is the difference between Task.Run() and Task.Factory.StartNew()?
Answer:

Task.Run(): A simplified and commonly used method to start a task in the thread pool.
Task.Factory.StartNew(): Provides more control over the task's creation, allowing you to specify options like scheduling behavior, task state, etc.
13. What is the role of async and await in threading?
Answer: async and await are keywords used in asynchronous programming to avoid blocking the main thread. They allow you to write non-blocking code that will continue executing after an awaited asynchronous task completes, improving the responsiveness of applications, especially UI apps.

14. What is Interlocked class in .NET?
Answer: The Interlocked class provides atomic operations for variables that are shared by multiple threads. This ensures that the operations are thread-safe without needing locks.

csharp
Copy code
int value = 0;
Interlocked.Increment(ref value);
15. What is a Semaphore and how does it differ from Mutex?
Answer:

A Semaphore allows multiple threads to access a limited number of resources simultaneously. For example, a semaphore with a count of 3 will allow up to 3 threads to enter a critical section at the same time.
A Mutex, on the other hand, allows only one thread at a time and can be used across processes.
16. How can you stop a thread gracefully in .NET?
Answer: You can stop a thread gracefully by using a cancellation mechanism like a cancellation token instead of calling Thread.Abort(), which is unsafe and deprecated.

csharp
Copy code
bool stopRequested = false;

Thread thread = new Thread(() =>
{
    while (!stopRequested)
    {
        // Thread work
    }
});

stopRequested = true; // Signal the thread to stop
These questions cover the fundamentals of .NET threading, common use cases, and practical considerations for handling concurrency in a multi-threaded environment.
